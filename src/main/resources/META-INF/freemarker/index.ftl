<h1>CLA Github Integration</h1>
<p>This project is a self-hostable application that provides an easy way for contributors to sign Individual and Corporate Contributor License Agreements (CLAs). This information is then used to place CLA status information in the pull requests and commits of your projects. The content of the CLAs presented to signatories is customizable and versioned allowing for evolution over time. Information about signatories is emailed to a configurable email address for record keeping. In order to facilitate self-hosting, the application is designed to work in a PaaS environment such as Cloud Foundry or Heroku.</p>
